# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement a comprehensive QA testing suite for the music distribution API to ensure all endpoints, workflows, and integrations are functioning correctly. The testing suite will cover functional testing, integration testing, performance testing, and security validation to guarantee the API is production-ready and reliable for handling music release distribution workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want automated API endpoint testing, so that I can verify all REST endpoints return correct responses and handle edge cases properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API endpoint is called with valid parameters THEN the system SHALL return the expected HTTP status code and response format
2. WHEN any API endpoint is called with invalid parameters THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 422) with descriptive error messages
3. WHEN authentication-protected endpoints are accessed without valid tokens THEN the system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized
4. WHEN endpoints are accessed with insufficient permissions THEN the system SHALL return 403 Forbidden
5. WHEN endpoints receive malformed JSON payloads THEN the system SHALL return 422 Unprocessable Entity with validation details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want database integration testing, so that I can ensure all CRUD operations work correctly and data integrity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new records through API endpoints THEN the system SHALL persist data correctly in the database
2. WHEN updating existing records THEN the system SHALL modify only the specified fields and maintain referential integrity
3. WHEN deleting records THEN the system SHALL handle cascading deletes appropriately and maintain data consistency
4. WHEN querying records with filters THEN the system SHALL return accurate results matching the filter criteria
5. WHEN concurrent operations occur on the same data THEN the system SHALL handle race conditions without data corruption

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want workflow testing, so that I can validate end-to-end business processes like release creation, delivery, and partner distribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a complete release workflow is executed THEN the system SHALL progress through all stages (creation, validation, delivery, confirmation) successfully
2. WHEN delivery tasks are triggered THEN the system SHALL process them asynchronously and update status correctly
3. WHEN partner integrations are invoked THEN the system SHALL handle API calls to external services and process responses appropriately
4. WHEN webhook events are received THEN the system SHALL process them and trigger appropriate downstream actions
5. WHEN workflow errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle failures gracefully and provide meaningful error reporting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want performance testing, so that I can ensure the API can handle expected load and response times meet requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API receives normal load (up to 100 concurrent requests) THEN response times SHALL be under 500ms for 95% of requests
2. WHEN the API receives high load (up to 500 concurrent requests) THEN the system SHALL maintain stability without crashes
3. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL complete within acceptable time limits (under 1 second for complex queries)
4. WHEN file uploads occur THEN the system SHALL handle large files (up to 100MB) without timeout errors
5. WHEN memory usage is monitored during testing THEN it SHALL remain within acceptable limits without memory leaks

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want security testing, so that I can identify vulnerabilities and ensure the API is secure against common attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SQL injection attempts are made THEN the system SHALL prevent unauthorized database access
2. WHEN XSS payloads are submitted THEN the system SHALL sanitize input and prevent script execution
3. WHEN authentication bypass attempts are made THEN the system SHALL maintain access controls
4. WHEN rate limiting is tested THEN the system SHALL enforce request limits and return 429 Too Many Requests when exceeded
5. WHEN sensitive data is returned in responses THEN the system SHALL not expose passwords, tokens, or other confidential information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want external service integration testing, so that I can verify third-party integrations (MusicBrainz, AWS services, partner APIs) work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MusicBrainz API is called THEN the system SHALL handle successful responses and extract metadata correctly
2. WHEN MusicBrainz API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts and errors gracefully
3. WHEN AWS services (S3, SQS, etc.) are accessed THEN the system SHALL authenticate properly and perform operations successfully
4. WHEN partner APIs are called THEN the system SHALL handle various response formats and error conditions
5. WHEN external services return rate limit errors THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry logic

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want test reporting and monitoring, so that I can track test results, identify trends, and generate comprehensive reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL generate detailed reports with pass/fail status for each test case
2. WHEN test failures occur THEN the system SHALL capture error details, stack traces, and relevant context
3. WHEN performance tests run THEN the system SHALL record response times, throughput metrics, and resource usage
4. WHEN test suites complete THEN the system SHALL generate summary reports with overall health metrics
5. WHEN tests are run continuously THEN the system SHALL track trends and alert on degradation patterns

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want data validation testing, so that I can ensure all data transformations, serializations, and validations work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests contain schema-compliant data THEN the system SHALL process and validate data correctly
2. WHEN API requests contain invalid data types THEN the system SHALL return specific validation error messages
3. WHEN data is serialized for external APIs THEN the system SHALL format it according to partner specifications
4. WHEN file metadata is processed THEN the system SHALL extract and validate audio file information accurately
5. WHEN date/time fields are processed THEN the system SHALL handle timezone conversions and formatting correctly
