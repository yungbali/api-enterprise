## 1. Cold Email - Record Labels

**Subject:** Cut Your Distribution Costs by 60% While Reaching 50+ DSPs

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Label Name] has been expanding rapidly with some great releases lately. I'm curious - are you still manually uploading to each DSP individually?

Most African labels I work with waste 15-20 hours per release on manual distribution tasks. That's why I built an API that automates the entire process.

**What if you could:**
- Distribute to 50+ DSPs with one API call
- Reduce distribution costs from 15% to 5%
- Go live in 24 hours instead of 2-4 weeks
- Get real-time analytics across all platforms

[Label X] just saved $30K annually and increased their release velocity by 300%.

Worth a 15-minute call to see how this could work for [Label Name]?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. We're offering free migration for the first 10 labels. Interested?

## 2. Cold Email - Music Distributors

**Subject:** White-Label Distribution Platform - Scale to 1000+ Releases/Month

Hi [Name],

Quick question: How many releases does [Company] process monthly, and what's your biggest operational bottleneck?

I ask because I just helped a distributor in Kenya scale from 50 to 500 releases/month without hiring additional staff.

**The secret?** Our white-label distribution API handles:
- DDEX compliance automatically
- 50+ DSP integrations
- Real-time delivery tracking
- Custom branding for your clients

**Result:** 70% reduction in operational costs, 300% increase in capacity.

Would you be interested in a 20-minute demo showing how this could work for [Company]?

Best,
[Your Name]

**P.S.** We also offer revenue-sharing models if you prefer that to monthly fees.

**Subject:** Next Steps: Your Custom Integration Plan

Hi [Name],

Thanks for the demo yesterday! I'm excited about the potential to help [Company] automate your distribution workflow.

**Quick recap of what we discussed:**
- Current pain point: Manual processing of 100+ releases/month
- Our solution: API automation reducing processing time by 90%
- Your goal: Scale to 500 releases/month by Q3

**Next steps I'd recommend:**
1. 30-day pilot with your top 5 artists
2. Custom integration with your existing workflow
3. Staff training and knowledge transfer

I've attached a custom proposal based on your specific needs. The pilot would be completely free, and we'd handle all the technical setup.

## 6. Pricing Objection Response

**Subject:** Re: Pricing Discussion - ROI Breakdown

Hi [Name],

I understand the pricing seems high compared to traditional distributors. Let me break down the actual ROI:

**Current State (Traditional Distributor):**
- 15% revenue share on $100K annual revenue = $15,000
- 20 hours/month manual work @ $25/hour = $6,000
- **Total annual cost: $21,000**

**With Our Platform:**
- $299/month = $3,588 annually
- 2 hours/month manual work @ $25/hour = $600
- **Total annual cost: $4,188**

**Net savings: $16,812 annually**

Plus you get:
- 10x faster distribution
- Real-time analytics
- No revenue sharing
- Complete control

Would you like to start with a smaller pilot to prove the ROI?

Best,
[Your Name]
